# LiftSenseBarbellCollars

LiftSense Barbell Collars are a pair of weightlifting collars intended to provide the recreational Olympic Lifter with the necessary feedback to improve his or her Olympic Lifts. The LiftSense Barbell Collars in conjunction with a fully integrated python application allows the lifter to see his or her barbell path, velocity versus time, and peak velocity for every lift that he or she performs. The python application uses the built-in webcam of the PC to successfully track the barbell path in real-time using computer vision. The python application also simultaneously pulls data via Bluetooth from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) embedded in the LiftSense Barbell Collars to determine the velocity versus time and peak velocity of every lift. These metrics work jointly to provide the necessary critique to the Olympic Lifter on how to refine his or her technique.
